          The SFU Digital Humanities Innovation Lab, UBC Digital Scholarship in
          the Arts, Adaptive TEI Network, and UBC Research Commons are
          co-hosting the TEI Summer Sessions. This series offers three half-day
          sessions of short presentations, workshop, open discussion, and
          collaborative working that focus on justice-oriented encoding
          principles and the social, ethical, and political stakes of critical
          digital editing. We will describe how to determine the best TEI
          elements for your research goals, encode various kinds of texts, and
          integrate external research and resources into digital editions.

            </hgroup>
          </summary>
          <p> This session will offer an introduction to critical digital editing in TEI. In particular, this session will provide a hands-on introduction to how the TEI facilitates editorial markup for manuscript and print texts. Topics will include encoding manuscript features--such as additions, deletions, and other revisions in one or more hands--and editorial interventions, such as editorial notes, gaps, and supplied text; marking up interpretations and mechanisms for encoding analysis; and handling of figures, tables, and images.</p>

            </hgroup>
          </summary>
          <p>This session will focus on encoding, researching, and tagging entities in TEI. Topics will include how to encode organizations and people–names, personae, voices, states, traits, etc.–and how to find biographical and prosopographical data about them. We will also discuss locating and encoding places (physical and conceptual), their typology, geographical information, and attributes, and consider the geopolitical aspects of space, place, and location. Participants will also learn how to encode uncertain information about people and places and locate their attributes within time.</p>

          <p>The final meeting of our TEI Summer Sessions will primarily focus on multilingual text encoding practices and a variety of questions about language-based handling of digital texts encoded in TEI-XML. Participants will learn about the development of Unicode, glyph encoding, and the use of <code>@xml:lang</code> through hands-on activities involving parallel text encoding.</p>
